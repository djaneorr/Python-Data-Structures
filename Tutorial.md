## Welcome!
Hello! My name is Jane Orr, and I am a Software Engineering student at BYU-Idaho. This is a basic introduction to a few Data Structures that are commonly used in the industry. The Data Structures we are going to go over are Stacks, Linked Lists, and Trees. You may be confused on what these are now, but I assure you: it will become a lot clearer after you read this tutorial of sorts.
